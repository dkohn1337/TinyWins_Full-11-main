# TinyWins Go-To-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

TinyWins occupies a unique "blue ocean" position in the parenting app market: **the only premium behavior insights app for mindful, growth-focused parents**. While basic reward chart apps compete on price ($0-3) and family logistics apps (Cozi) serve different needs, TinyWins has no direct competition in the insight-driven positive parenting space.

**Strategic Positioning:** Premium quality, premium price, premium parents.

**Full Description:**

---

**Notice More. Nag Less.**

Tiny Wins helps you become the parent you want to be—one small win at a time.

**THE PROBLEM WITH PARENTING APPS**
Most behavior apps are glorified star charts. Count to 10, get a prize, repeat. But that's not parenting—that's bribing.

TinyWins is different. We help you *see* what's already good about your child, track what actually matters, and understand the patterns that make your family tick.

**WHAT MAKES TINYWINS SPECIAL**

✦ **Daily Notices** — Quick logging that takes 10 seconds, not 10 minutes
✦ **Insight Dashboard** — See patterns: when tantrums happen, what triggers good days
✦ **Growth Rings** — Watch character traits (kindness, patience, courage) develop over time
✦ **Co-Parent Sync** — Both parents on the same page, same data, same approach
✦ **Positive Ratio Tracking** — Science says 4:1 positive-to-negative builds resilience. We help you hit it.
✦ **Beautiful Design** — An app you actually want to open (and show to grandma)

**WHO IT'S FOR**
- Parents who read parenting books (and want to apply them)
- Families who've tried star charts and found them hollow
- Co-parents who want shared visibility
- Anyone who wants to yell less and connect more

**FREE VS PLUS**

*Free:* 1 child, 1 goal, 7 days of insights, basic features
*Plus:* Up to 5 children, 3 goals each, 6 months of insights, co-parent sync, growth rings, premium analytics, priority support

**WHAT PARENTS SAY**
"I finally feel like I'm noticing the good stuff instead of just putting out fires." — Sarah, mom of 2

"The insights blew my mind. I had no idea tantrums clustered around 5pm every day." — Mike, dad of 3

"My ex and I finally agree on something—this app." — Jamie, co-parent

**OUR PHILOSOPHY**
Kids don't need more rewards. They need to be *seen*.

TinyWins helps you see your child's character emerging—their kindness, their courage, their patience—and reflect it back to them. That's not motivation through prizes. That's motivation through meaning.

Download TinyWins and start noticing the tiny wins that add up to big growth.
