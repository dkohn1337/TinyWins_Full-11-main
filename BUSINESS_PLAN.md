## 1. Executive Summary

### The Opportunity

**The parenting app market is a $600M+ opportunity with no dominant player in behavior insights.**

Parents spend $750/year on children's apps, but existing behavior/reward apps are either:
- **Too basic** (star charts with no insights)
- **Too complex** (clinical tools designed for therapists)
- **Abandoned** (OurHome: unpublished 2023, last update 2020)

TinyWins fills this gap as **the first premium parenting insight app** that combines quick behavior logging with meaningful analytics, character development tracking, and co-parent synchronization.

### The Product

TinyWins helps growth-minded parents:
- **Notice the good** — Quick 10-second behavior logging
- **Understand patterns** — When tantrums happen, what triggers good days
- **Watch character grow** — Visual "Growth Rings" showing kindness, courage, patience developing
- **Stay aligned as partners** — Real-time co-parent sync with shared data

### The Business Model

**Freemium subscription with strong unit economics:**

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 1 child, 1 goal, 7-day insights |
| Plus Monthly | $4.99/mo | 5 children, 3 goals, 6-month insights, co-parent sync, Growth Rings |
| Plus Annual | $29.99/yr | Same as monthly, 50% savings |
| Lifetime | $79.99 | Permanent Plus access |

**Target Unit Economics:**
- LTV: $55+
- CAC: $12-15
- LTV/CAC: 3.5x+
- Payback: < 90 days

### The Founder Advantage

**Dor Kohn** brings a rare combination of skills to TinyWins:

| Asset | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **8+ years product leadership** | $50M ARR P&L ownership, knows subscription economics |
| **AI/ML product expertise** | Led 7-model AI system, can build intelligent features |
| **Startup founding experience** | 0→50K devices at Surfsight, understands early-stage execution |

| **Full-time job provides runway** | No pressure to raise, can build patiently |
| **AI-assisted development** | Ships at team velocity while solo |

### The Approach: Bootstrapped to Profitability

**TinyWins is built as a profitable side project, not a VC-dependent startup.**

| Metric | Bootstrapped Model |
|--------|-------------------|
| Monthly expenses | ~$135 (essentials only) |
| Funding required | $0 |
| Time to profitability | Month 1 |
| Year 1 net profit | ~$43,000+ |
| Founder ownership | 100% |

**Projected 18-Month Outcome (Bootstrapped):**
- 30,000+ downloads
- 3,000+ paying subscribers
- $100K+ ARR
- Profitable throughout
- Product-market fit validated

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Frontend (iOS)** | Swift 5.9 + SwiftUI | Native iOS performance, modern declarative UI |
| **Frontend (Android)** | Kotlin + Jetpack Compose | Native Android, mirrors SwiftUI architecture |
| **State Management** | ObservableObject + @EnvironmentObject | Standard SwiftUI patterns |
| **Local Storage** | JSON + FileManager | Simple, debuggable, portable |
| **Cloud Sync** | Firebase Firestore | Real-time sync, offline support, generous free tier |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Auth + Apple/Google Sign-In | Cross-platform auth, privacy-friendly |
| **Subscriptions** | StoreKit 2 / Google Play Billing | Platform-native billing APIs |
| **Analytics** | TelemetryDeck | Privacy-first analytics |
| **Crash Reporting** | Firebase Crashlytics | Industry standard, cross-platform |
| **Development Tools** | Claude Code, ChatGPT | AI-assisted development for rapid iteration |

### AI-Assisted Development

TinyWins leverages modern AI development tools to accelerate development while maintaining code quality:

- **Claude Code (Anthropic):** Primary development assistant for architecture decisions, code generation, refactoring, and debugging. Enables a solo founder to ship features at the pace of a small team.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Secondary tool for research, copywriting, and alternative perspectives.

**Monthly tooling cost:** ~$120/month ($100 Claude + $20 ChatGPT)

This AI-assisted approach allows the founder to:
1. Ship production-quality code faster than traditional solo development
2. Maintain architectural consistency across the codebase
3. Generate comprehensive documentation and tests
4. Explore multiple implementation approaches quickly
5. Focus founder time on product decisions rather than syntax

As the team grows, these tools will remain valuable for onboarding, code review assistance, and maintaining development velocity.

### Product Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Q1 2025)
- [x] Core behavior logging
- [x] Reward system with goals
- [x] Basic insights (7-day)
- [x] Premium subscriptions (StoreKit 2)
- [x] Character trait mapping
- [ ] Co-parent sync (Firebase) — In Progress
- [ ] Growth Rings visualization — In Progress

#### Phase 2: Growth (Q2 2025)

- [ ] Web dashboard (view-only for grandparents)
- [ ] Apple Watch complications
- [ ] Widget support
- [ ] Siri shortcuts

### Android Development Strategy

Android represents ~45% of US smartphone users and is critical for co-parent sync (many couples have mixed iOS/Android households). The Android app will be developed in Q3-Q4 2025 following iOS feature parity.

#### Technical Approach

| Aspect | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Language** | Kotlin | Modern, null-safe, Google-recommended |
| **UI Framework** | Jetpack Compose | Declarative UI mirrors SwiftUI patterns |
| **Architecture** | MVVM + Repository | Matches iOS architecture for code logic portability |
| **Backend** | Firebase (shared) | Same backend as iOS, instant data sync |
| **Subscriptions** | Google Play Billing Library v6+ | Required for Play Store |
| **Min SDK** | API 26 (Android 8.0) | Covers 95%+ of active devices |

#### Code Sharing Strategy

While native development is chosen over cross-platform (React Native, Flutter) for performance and platform-native feel, significant logic can be shared:

1. **Data Models:** JSON schemas identical, easy to port
2. **Business Logic:** Algorithm logic (trait mapping, insights) translatable
3. **Backend:** Firebase SDK available for both platforms
4. **API Contracts:** Identical Firestore document structure

**Estimated development time:** 3-4 months for feature parity with iOS

#### Android-Specific Considerations

| Feature | iOS | Android Equivalent |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| StoreKit 2 | Google Play Billing Library |
| Apple Sign-In | Google Sign-In + Email |
| iCloud Backup | Google Drive backup |
| Widgets | App Widgets (Glance) |
| Push Notifications | Firebase Cloud Messaging (shared) |

#### Development Options

**Option A: Founder builds with AI assistance (Budget-conscious)**
- Timeline: 4-5 months part-time
- Cost: ~$0 (founder time + existing AI tools)
- Risk: Slower, learning curve for Kotlin

**Option B: Contract Android developer (Recommended)**
- Timeline: 3 months
- Cost: $15,000-25,000 (contract)
- Risk: Lower, proven expertise

**Option C: Part-time hire (If Year 1 revenue goals met)**
- Timeline: Ongoing
- Cost: $40,000-50,000/year (part-time)
- Benefit: Maintenance, updates, future features

#### Play Store Considerations

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Developer Account | Pending | $25 one-time fee |
| App Signing | Planned | Play App Signing required |
| Privacy Policy | Complete | Same as iOS |
| Data Safety Form | Planned | Required disclosure |
| Family Policy | Planned | If targeting children |
| Subscription Compliance | Planned | Clear cancellation flows |

#### Success Metrics for Android Launch

| Metric | Target (Month 3 post-launch) |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Play Store Rating | 4.3+ |
| Android % of total users | 25-35% |
| Cross-platform families using sync | 500+ |
| Android-specific crash rate | <1% |
| Feature parity with iOS | 100% |

#### Phase 4: Platform (2026)
- [ ] API for third-party integrations
- [ ] Professional tools (therapists, schools)
- [ ] "TinyWins for ADHD" vertical
- [ ] International localization

### Intellectual Property & Moats

| Moat | Description | Defensibility |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Growth Rings** | Unique character visualization | Medium (can be copied) |
| **Behavior-Trait Mapping** | 40+ behaviors mapped to 6 traits | Medium |
| **Co-Parent Network Effects** | Both parents need the app | High |
| **Data Lock-in** | Months of family data | High |
| **Brand Trust** | Parents are cautious about kids apps | Medium |

## 5. Business Model

### Revenue Model: Freemium Subscription

**Why Subscription (not ads or one-time purchase):**

1. **Aligned incentives** — We make money when users stay engaged, not when we sell their data
2. **Predictable revenue** — Enables planning and investment
3. **Parenting is ongoing** — 3-12 years of need per family
4. **Premium positioning** — Signals quality, attracts right customers
5. **Industry standard** — Users expect subscription for premium apps

### Pricing Strategy

| Plan | Price | Monthly Equivalent | Target Segment |
|------|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Monthly** | $4.99/mo | $4.99 | Skeptics, tryers |
| **Annual** | $29.99/yr | $2.50 | Primary target (70%+) |
| **Lifetime** | $79.99 | N/A | Super fans, gift buyers |

**Pricing Rationale:**

- **$4.99/mo** — Below psychological threshold ($5), competitive with Headspace/Calm tier
- **$29.99/yr** — Strong 50% savings incentive, under $30 annual gift card threshold
- **$79.99 lifetime** — 2.7x annual, attractive for multi-year users

**Comparison to Market:**

| App | Monthly | Annual |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Headspace | $12.99 | $69.99 |
| Calm | $14.99 | $69.99 |
| Duolingo Plus | $12.99 | $83.99 |
| Strava | $11.99 | $79.99 |
| **TinyWins** | **$4.99** | **$29.99** |

TinyWins is positioned as **accessible premium** — quality experience at family-friendly prices.

### Unit Economics

#### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Monthly churn: 5%
- Average subscription length: 20 months
- Annual subscribers: 70% of paid users
- Monthly subscribers: 25% of paid users
- Lifetime purchasers: 5% of paid users

**Calculation:**

| Segment | Price | Duration | LTV | Weight |
|---------|-------|----------|-----|--------|
| Monthly | $4.99 | 10 months | $49.90 | 25% |
| Annual | $29.99 | 2 years | $59.98 | 70% |
| Lifetime | $79.99 | One-time | $79.99 | 5% |

**Blended LTV: $55.32**

#### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Target: < $15**

| Channel | Est. CAC | Volume | Notes |
|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| Organic (ASO) | $0 | 40% | Zero cost, high quality |
| Apple Search Ads | $8-12 | 30% | High intent |
| Social paid | $15-25 | 20% | Broader reach |
| Influencer | $10-15 | 10% | CPM deals |

**Blended CAC Target: $8-12**

#### LTV/CAC Ratio

**Target: > 3x**

- Conservative: $55 / $15 = **3.7x**
- Optimistic: $60 / $10 = **6.0x**

#### Payback Period

**Target: < 90 days**

- Annual subscriber: Day 1 (pays upfront)
- Monthly subscriber: 3 months at $4.99 = $14.97

**Blended payback: ~45 days**

### Revenue Projections (See Section 8)

### Additional Revenue Opportunities (Future)

| Opportunity | Timeline | Potential |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Family plan** (2 subscriptions, 20% discount) | 2025 | +10-15% revenue |
| **Gifting** (annual subscription as gift) | Q4 2025 | +5% Q4 revenue |
| **B2B** (therapists, schools) | 2026 | New segment |
| **Courses/content** (parenting masterclass upsell) | 2026 | High margin |
| **Physical goods** (star chart poster, celebration kit) | 2027 | Low margin, brand building |

### Expense Projections

#### Year 1 Expenses (Bootstrapped Scenario)

TinyWins operates as a lean, bootstrapped side project with minimal burn. The founder maintains full-time employment, eliminating salary requirements and enabling patient growth.

**Essential Expenses Only:**

| Category | Monthly | Annual | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Personnel** | | | |
| - Founder salary | $0 | $0 | Full-time job provides income; TinyWins is equity-only |
| **Development Tools** | | | |
| - Claude Code (Anthropic) | $100 | $1,200 | Primary AI development assistant |
| - ChatGPT Plus (OpenAI) | $20 | $240 | Secondary AI tool |
| **Infrastructure** | | | |
| - Firebase/hosting | $0-25 | $0-300 | Free tier covers early growth |
| - Apple Developer | $8 | $99 | Annual fee (required) |
| - Google Play Developer | — | $25 | One-time fee (when Android launches) |
| - Domain & email | $4 | $50 | tinywins.app |

**Year 1 Essential Expenses: ~$1,600-1,900**

**Optional Expenses (Add If/When Revenue Supports):**

| Category | Trigger | Monthly | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Paid acquisition (ASA) | $1K+ MRR | $100-500 | Scale with proven ROI |
| Influencer marketing | $2K+ MRR | $100-300 | Micro-influencers, product trades |
| Content/creative tools | As needed | $20-50 | Canva Pro, stock assets |
| Legal/accounting | Year-end | $200-500 | Annual tax prep only |

**Realistic Year 1 Expense Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Expenses | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Minimum viable** | ~$1,600 | Essential tools only, organic growth |
| **With modest marketing** | ~$3,000 | Add some ASA when revenue proves demand |
| **With all optionals** | ~$5,000 | Full marketing spend, professional services |

**Year 1 Financial Outcomes:**

| Scenario | Expenses | Revenue | Net Profit |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| **Minimum** | $1,600 | $45,000 | **+$43,400** |
| **Moderate** | $3,000 | $45,000 | **+$42,000** |
| **Full optional** | $5,000 | $45,000 | **+$40,000** |

**Key Principle:** Marketing spend follows revenue, not the other way around. Paid acquisition only starts when organic growth validates demand and unit economics are proven.

This lean approach differs dramatically from the funded scenario:

| Scenario | Year 1 Expenses | Year 1 Net | Break-even |
|----------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| **Bootstrapped (minimum)** | $1,600 | +$43,400 | Month 1 |
| **Bootstrapped (moderate)** | $3,000 | +$42,000 | Month 1 |
| **Funded** | $225,000 | -$180,000 | Month 18-20 |

The bootstrapped path maximizes profit and ownership by treating every expense as optional until proven necessary.

#### Year 1 Expenses (If Funded - Alternative Scenario)

If TinyWins raises seed funding, expenses would scale:

| Category | Monthly | Annual | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **Personnel** | | | |
| - Founder salary | $4,000 | $48,000 | Below market, equity compensation |
| - Engineer (Mo 4+) | $8,000 | $72,000 | $120K annual, starts Month 4 |
| - Marketing (Mo 3+) | $5,500 | $55,000 | $80K annual, starts Month 3 |
| **Development Tools** | | | |
| - AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT) | $120 | $1,440 | Team access |
| **Infrastructure** | | | |
| - Firebase/hosting | $50 | $600 | Scales with usage |
| - Apple Developer | $8 | $99 | Annual fee |
| - Tools & software | $200 | $2,400 | Analytics, design, etc. |
| **Marketing** | | | |

| - Influencers | $1,000 | $12,000 | 10-15 partnerships |
| - Content/creative | $500 | $6,000 | Design, video, etc. |
| **Operations** | | | |
| - Legal/accounting | $300 | $3,600 | Bookkeeping, legal review |
| - Miscellaneous | $200 | $2,400 | Travel, equipment, etc. |

**Year 1 Total Expenses (Funded): ~$225,000**
**Year 1 Net (Funded): (~$180,000)** — Investment phase

#### Year 2 Expenses

| Category | Annual | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Personnel | $350,000 | Team of 4-5 |
| Infrastructure | $5,000 | Growing usage |
| Marketing | $80,000 | Scale proven channels |
| Operations | $15,000 | Legal, accounting, etc. |

**Year 2 Total Expenses: ~$450,000**
**Year 2 Net: (~$110,000)** — Approaching break-even

#### Year 3 Expenses

| Category | Annual | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Personnel | $550,000 | Team of 6-7 |
| Infrastructure | $15,000 | Scale + Android |
| Marketing | $200,000 | Aggressive growth |
| Operations | $35,000 | Growing complexity |

**Year 3 Total Expenses: ~$800,000**
**Year 3 Net: +$250,000** — **Profitable**

### Key Financial Metrics

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $45K | $340K | $1.05M |
| Expenses | $225K | $450K | $800K |

## 9. Risk Analysis

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Apple policy changes** | Medium | High | Diversify to Android/web, comply proactively |
| **Well-funded competitor** | Medium | High | Move fast, build brand, lock in partnerships |
| **Subscription fatigue** | High | Medium | Demonstrate value quickly, optimize onboarding |
| **Low conversion rates** | Medium | High | A/B test constantly, iterate on paywall |
| **Engineer hiring difficulty** | Medium | Medium | Remote-friendly, competitive equity |
| **Founder burnout** | Medium | High | Hire help early, sustainable pace |
| **Data breach** | Low | Critical | Local-first architecture, minimal collection |
| **Negative PR ("gamifying kids")** | Low | High | Lead with research, testimonials |
| **Firebase pricing changes** | Low | Medium | Abstract backend, evaluate alternatives |
| **Economic downturn** | Medium | Medium | Parenting is recession-resistant, but adjust |

### Detailed Risk Mitigation

#### Risk: Apple Policy Changes

**Scenario:** Apple changes App Store rules affecting subscriptions or parenting apps.

**Mitigation:**
1. Maintain App Store relationship (respond to reviews, follow guidelines)
2. Build Android app (removes single-platform dependency)
3. Develop web version for non-app access
4. Keep 6+ months runway for adaptation

#### Risk: Well-Funded Competitor

**Scenario:** A startup raises $10M+ to build a similar app, or a big tech company enters.

**Mitigation:**
1. **Speed:** Ship faster than they can copy
2. **Depth:** Build features they won't prioritize (Growth Rings, trait analysis)
3. **Community:** Create loyal user base that advocates
4. **Partnerships:** Lock in exclusive influencer/distribution deals
5. **Acquisition:** Be an attractive acquisition target

#### Risk: Low Conversion Rates

**Scenario:** Free-to-paid conversion stays below 3%.

**Mitigation:**
1. A/B test paywall design, timing, messaging
2. Improve value demonstration in free tier
3. Add more premium-only features
4. Experiment with pricing (higher prices can signal quality)
5. Consider longer free trial for annual

#### Risk: Founder Burnout

**Scenario:** Solo founder cannot sustain pace required.

**Mitigation:**
1. Hire help with seed funding (engineer + marketer)
2. Set sustainable work hours (no all-nighters)
3. Take real vacations (app will survive)
4. Build advisor network for support
5. Consider co-founder if right person emerges

---

## 10. Funding Strategy

### Primary Path: Bootstrapped Growth

TinyWins is designed to be profitable without external funding. The founder's full-time employment provides personal runway, and the business model generates positive cash flow from early subscribers.

### Current Funding Status

- **Raised to date:** $0 (bootstrapped)
- **Personal investment:** ~$1,500 (tools, fees, initial setup)
- **Monthly burn:** ~$135 (essentials only, covered by personal income)
- **Runway:** Indefinite (no salary dependency)

### Why Bootstrapping First

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| **100% ownership** | No dilution until PMF is proven |
| **No investor pressure** | Build at sustainable pace, make long-term decisions |
| **Forced efficiency** | Every dollar spent must be justified |
| **Optionality preserved** | Can raise later from position of strength |
| **Personal validation** | If founder won't fund it, why should investors? |

### Bootstrapped Financial Model (Primary Scenario)

| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue | Expenses | Net |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|-----|
| Month 6 | Q2 2025 | $12K cumulative | ~$800 | +$11.2K |
| Month 12 | Q4 2025 | $45K cumulative | ~$1,600 | +$43.4K |
| Month 18 | Q2 2026 | $90K cumulative | ~$3K | +$87K |
| Month 24 | Q4 2026 | $170K cumulative | ~$8K | +$162K |

*Note: Expenses increase as revenue grows (adding marketing, contractors when ROI is proven)*

At these margins, TinyWins can self-fund:
- Part-time engineer hire at ~$5K MRR
- Marketing spend increases at ~$8K MRR
- Founder full-time transition at ~$15K MRR

### Optional: Seed Round ($250K-500K)

If strategic acceleration is desired, TinyWins would consider a small seed round:

**When to raise:**
- PMF validated (NPS > 50, <5% churn)
- Clear path to $500K+ ARR
- Specific growth opportunities requiring capital (Android, international, team)

**Use of Funds (18 months):**

| Category | Amount | % of Total | Purpose |
|----------|--------|------------|---------|
| **Personnel** | $200,000-325,000 | 65% | Engineer, Marketer, Founder part-time salary |
| **Marketing** | $50,000-100,000 | 20% | Paid acquisition, influencers, content |
| **Operations** | $25,000-50,000 | 10% | Legal, accounting, tools, infrastructure |
| **Reserve** | $12,500-25,000 | 5% | Contingency |

**Milestones to Achieve:**

1. **Product:** Ship co-parent sync, Growth Rings, Android app
2. **Users:** 50,000+ downloads, 10,000+ MAU
3. **Revenue:** 5,000+ subscribers, $150K+ ARR
4. **Team:** 2-3 employees (lean)
5. **PMF:** NPS > 50, <5% monthly churn

### Investor Profile (If Raising)

**Ideal Investor:**
- Angel or small seed fund ($50K-250K check sizes)
- Experience with consumer subscription apps
- Parenting/family tech interest or expertise
- Patient capital (7-10 year horizon, no forced exits)
- Value-add: Marketing, App Store, or parenting connections
- Comfortable with founder maintaining full-time job initially

**What We Offer:**
- Large market with no dominant player
- Proven subscription model
- Capital-efficient growth (profitable without funding)
- Experienced product leader with B2B scale-up background
- Authentic founder-market fit (parent of 2)
- Low-risk entry point (already building, already validating)

### Valuation Guidance

**Pre-money valuation range:** $1.5M - $2.5M (for $250K-500K raise)

**Rationale:**
- Conservative for pre-revenue consumer app
- Reflects bootstrapped progress and de-risked execution
- Leaves room for meaningful investor returns
- Comparable to angels investing in experienced founders with MVPs

### Path to Profitability

| Path | Funding | Timeline to $50K MRR | Founder Ownership |
|------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Bootstrapped** | $0 | 30-36 months | 100% |
| **Small seed ($250K)** | $250K at $1.5M | 24-30 months | 85%+ |
| **Full seed ($500K)** | $500K at $2.5M | 18-24 months | 80%+ |

**Recommended path:** Bootstrapped until PMF, then evaluate strategic raise for acceleration.

### Future Funding (If Applicable)

**Series A (24-36 months out):**
- Trigger: $500K+ ARR, clear PMF, international expansion opportunity
- Amount: $2-4M
- Use: Scale marketing, Android, international, team
- Only if organic growth is insufficient for opportunity size

**Dor Kohn**
- **Role:** Product, Engineering, Strategy (part-time, building alongside full-time job)
- **Location:** Haifa, Israel
- **Contact:** dkohn1337@gmail.com | linkedin.com/in/dorkohn

**Professional Background:**

Dor brings 8+ years of experience building AI-powered B2B platforms from zero to scale, with direct P&L ownership for a $50M ARR product line serving 350K+ connected devices. His background is uniquely suited to building TinyWins:

| Experience | Relevance to TinyWins |
|------------|----------------------|
| **Senior Product Manager, Lytx Inc.** (2021-Present) | P&L ownership, subscription business models, AI/ML product development |
| **$50M ARR product line ownership** | Understanding unit economics, churn reduction, retention strategies |
| **AI-14 flagship launch ($12M ARR Year 1)** | End-to-end product launches, go-to-market execution |
| **Platform transformation leadership** | Architecture decisions, multi-year roadmap planning |

| **Churn analytics system (reduced churn 18% → 8%)** | Data-driven retention, cohort analysis |
| **Founding team, Surfsight (0 → 50K devices)** | Startup execution, product-market fit, Series A contribution |

**Key Strengths Applied to TinyWins:**

1. **Product Vision & Strategy:** Defined 3-year roadmaps presented to boards; can articulate long-term vision while executing near-term
2. **Subscription Business Expertise:** Built churn prediction systems, understands LTV/CAC dynamics from $50M ARR experience

**Current Commitment:**

TinyWins is currently a side project built alongside a full-time Senior Product Manager role. This approach provides:
- **Financial runway:** No pressure to raise or monetize prematurely
- **Real-world validation:** Building and testing with actual family use
- **Risk mitigation:** Can validate PMF before going full-time
- **Proven execution:** Demonstrates ability to ship while managing competing priorities

**Transition Plan:**
- **Current:** Part-time (10-15 hrs/week)

TinyWins takes a capital-efficient approach to hiring, scaling team investment with revenue validation. The founder's AI-assisted development approach enables shipping at near-team velocity while solo.

#### Phase 1: Bootstrapped (Current - Until Year 1 Revenue Goals Met)

**Team:** Founder only + AI development tools

No hires until the business validates with real revenue. This approach:
- Maintains 100% equity
- Eliminates burn rate pressure
- Forces product-market fit before scaling
- Proves the founder can execute

**Essential costs:**
- Claude Code: $100/month
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month
- Apple Developer: $99/year (~$8/month)
- Domain: ~$50/year (~$4/month)
- Firebase: $0 (free tier)
- **Total:** ~$135/month

*Marketing, legal, and other expenses added only when revenue justifies them.*

#### Phase 2: First Hire - Part-Time Mobile Engineer (If Year 1 Goals Met)

**Trigger:** Achieving Year 1 revenue targets (~$45K revenue, ~3,000 subscribers)

**Role:** Part-Time Mobile App Engineer (Contract or Part-Time Employee)

**Requirements:**

**Responsibilities:**

- Code review and quality improvements

**Why Part-Time First:**
- Matches actual workload (maintenance vs. new development)
- Lower commitment while validating team dynamics
- Founder continues feature development with AI assistance
- Can scale to full-time if needed

#### Phase 3: Growth Hires (If/When Funded or $10K+ MRR)

**Senior iOS Engineer (Full-Time)**

**Requirements:**
- 5+ years iOS development

**Responsibilities:**
